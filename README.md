# phase-1-project
This project is made by Peter, Seth, and Gian!
Gehrig's Brewery Browser/Brewhunter is a website made for finding Breweries in or near cities.
Users have the ability to type in a city they would like to find breweries in or near and then
click on any Breweries that interest them to provide information on that brewery. The users
are also able to add a like to any brewery that they wish.
The brewery information provided will include:
1. The name of the brewery
2. The address of the brewery
3. The website of the brewery
4. A picture preview of the brewery
5. Add "like" functionality
